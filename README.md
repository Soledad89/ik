**ik - Jonathan's Inverse Kinematic Library**
---------
---------

**Overview**
--------

This library is a bunch of stuff ripped out of my private library (jtil) for the use of doing gradient-descent based inverse kinematics.

**Compilation**
---------------

Building jtil uses Visual Studio 2012 on Windows.  There are no dependencies.  The code is also cross platform (and compiles using gcc on Mac OS X), but I have not included any CMake files because I got sick of supporting them.

**Style**
---------

This project follows the Google C++ style conventions:
